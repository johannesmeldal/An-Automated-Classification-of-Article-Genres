unveils his budget for fiscal 198788 exceptionally robust tax revenues have given lawson very favourable budget options with which to please voters industry and financial markets alike the budget will lawsons fourth and probably the last from the conservative government before the next general election political analysts say analysts said the major budget question is how lawson will balance expected tax cuts with lower public borrowing and allow for fresh falls in uk interest rates they said a boost given to the economy by consumer spending has helped reduce the public sector borrowing requirement psbr for financial 198687 from an originally targetted 71 billion stg despite big rises in government spending economists say lawson may have up to five billion stg to split between income tax cuts and other electoral sweeteners higher spending and a drop in borrowing while still meeting his earlier 198788 psbr target of 70 billion stg the decision facing lawson is how best to use that socalled fiscal adjustement to maximise the governments allround popularity ahead of the next general election economist ian harwood of warburg securities said lawsons budget must strike a balance between tax cuts aimed at home consumption and lower public borrowing for attracting support from overseas investors peter fellner of james capel and co said a budget which concentrates on tax cuts for the consumer will be a budget for an early election prime minister margaret thatcher must call a poll before june 1988 but anticipation of a summer or autumn 1987 ballot has risen as the opposition labour party has slipped in voter surveys forecasts that the economy may deteriorate later this year add to arguments for an early poll analysts say the conservatives have pledged to cut the basic rate of taxation in the uk from the current 29 pct level to 25 pct while confirming that aim prime minister margaret thatcher last month seemed to dash speculation that that would happen in the near future she said in a television interview that it would happen eventually but i think it will be eventually most market analysts now expect a twopence reduction in the basic rate of taxation and a lowering in of the top rate of income tax from 60 pct a one billion stg cut in the 198788 psbr to six billion stg is considered the minimum needed for reassuring financial markets they add the treasurys inflow of tax receipts has far surpassed that previously envisaged economists say lawson as recently as december 17 said that i very much doubt whether there will be much scope for reductions in taxation in next years budget the conservative government is eager to get the basic rate of tax down to 25 pct as soon as possible since every pound off the tax base would make the opposition labour partys spending plans look more painful to the electorate analysts say the direct revenue effect of a one penny change in the basic rate of income tax would be about 11 billion stg in 198788 and 145 billion stg in 198889 treasury figures show lawsons budget speech to parliament on tuesday starts at 1530 gmt and is sure to echo the governments distinct tone of optimism analysts say the tax measures which lawson is expected to announce will be based firmly on a positive assessment of past economic achievements and confidence for the future they add but even if he does cut his planned psbr for 198788 by between one and 15 billion stg as most economists predict lawson is still likely to find himself announcing a higher psbr than the outturn for this financial yearm that could leave him with a presentation problem economists say a lower psbr would raise financial confidence by reassuring markets that the borrowing burden imposed by the government would stay low even if certain key aspects of the budgets arithmetic seem overoptimistic economists say lawson is slated to reaffirm the governments goals as set out in its medium term financial strategy mtfs of reducing inflation and raising economic growth regarding monetary targets some analysts expect him to drop the wayward broad money aggregate sterling m3 while retaining the tamer m0 narrow measure few foresee any other monetary aggregate being chosen by lawson for formal targeting analysts were surprised this week when the government sanctioned a half percentage point cut in interest rates in an attempt to cool down sterling and the gilts market analysts had expected the authorities to wait until after the budget further declines in bank base lending rates are anticipated after the budget many analysts foresee them falling by as much as a full percentage point from the current 105 pct level the main electoral attraction of reducing interest rates is to cut mortgage borrowing costs and thus reduce

makers own doing traders and bank officials said for the last six months there have been a series of crises in the frn market each has cut deeper and deeper into the very fibre of the market said a senior official at a us bank as prices have fallen he explained the underwriters who originally brought the issues have retreated they have divested themselves of the paper as quickly as possible unwilling to bear losses of the magnitude seen in recent panic trading in the virtual effective closure of the market for perpetual floaters last month bankers witnessed the consequences of this kind of contraction of liquidity and investor confidence fears were engendered about the possibility of this crisis infecting the market in conventional dated frn issues which is almost 10 times as large as that for perpetuals with an estimated 130 billion dlrs of debt outstanding the professionals are so nervous about holding inventory that they will sell at any price said an official at a leading us bank explaining the panic selling which has pushed prices down sharply over the last two days bankers and frn traders emphasised that todays trading was unique in that it was driven exclusively by professionals and that there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the securities they sold in highlighting this point dealers noted that the benchmark issues in the frn market the two frns for the uk launched in 1985 and 1986 fell an unprecedented 50 and 40 basis points respectively at the opening this morning certainly dealers said britain is no less creditworthy today than it was yesterday and the countrys economic health currently appears better than it has for some time pointing out that this kind of sovereign and supranational debt had not sagged on any fundamental weakness one senior frn source said the idiocy of the situation is aptly shown by the fact that these kind of borrowers can now tap the syndicated loan markets at rates lower than their floaters currently pay dealers agreed that banking sector paper which constitutes a significant part of the market was currently under pressure floating rate debt of major us and canadian banks eased markedly in nervous trading last month on renewed investor fears about the banks exposure to latin american debt the us and canadian money centre bank frns along with republic of ireland paper were hard hit again this week with dealers citing one heavilytraded citicorp note falling to levels so low it is now effectively yielding 55 basis points over libor the london interbank offered rate by comparison the 500 mln dlr note which matures in 1998 yielded only a fine 20 basis point over libid the london interbank bid rate when it was issued in january last year price declines of this size can really only be explained by an understanding of the operating practices of leading players in the market dealers and banking analysts said this has to be understood as a matter between banks who have a brief to buy low and sell high one us bank source noted another senior source at a uk bank drew attention to the enormous overhead costs and high salaries generated over the last few years in the frn market which have to be justified but even beyond the cost of running an frn trading desk dealers said is the way the securities are bought and sold although sophisticated onscreen dealing exists in most markets in the euromarkets trading is conducted by telephone if somebody calls you up and asks you to make him a price in any issue and you do he can say right you own five mln a trader said explaining market practice the unfortunate buyer is then forced to unload the securities just minutes later to yet another firm at an even lower price the trader explained it is precisely this phenomenon that forced the rapid downward price spiral earlier today traders said adding that it is likely to continue until the markets either regain their confidence or market practices change one possible solution dealers said would be to initiate trading exclusively through brokers screens so that only those who wanted to buy bonds would have to lift a bid or buy at that price meanwhile bank regulators are apparently concerned about the implications of the collapse in frn prices traders in london said that the bank of england has called around to market makers asking whether they intended to continue trading and what they calculated the losses to be the bank often makes periodic checks in the market but dealers said the latest enquiries were more specific a spokesman for the bank of england was

of lehman government securities inc there are hints that gnp is picking up on the inflation front all is well he said money supply is well under control its an absolutely ideal situation february us industrial production rose 05 pct slightly less than the 07 pct gain the financial markets had expected this compared with a slim 01 pct rise in januarys production number previously reported as a 04 pct increase the february us producer price index gained only 01 pct less than a 0304 pct expected rise this followed a 06 pct rise in the ppi in january the fed is going to look at this positively said allan leslie of discount corporation certainly inflation is not as bad as what volcker fed chairman has said lately industrial production growth is along the lines of what the fed wants the energy products component of ppi rose 40 pct in february after a 98 pct increase in january this shows that the impact of energy prices on inflation is behind us in terms of the move from 15 dlrs to 18 dlrs per barrel said maria ramirez of drexel burnham lambert inc the trend is still 35 pct in the first half of the year in 1986 declining energy prices contributed to a 25 pct decline in the ppi

chairman paul volcker said that a possibility of renewed inflation remains a concern in both the financial markets and the federal reserve the fed may be lowering its own inflation expectations today said robert brusca of nikko securities international while low inflation permits the fed to maintain an easier monetary policy brusca said if import prices do not rise this could necessitate a weaker dollar the outlook for the dollar is still up in the air he said we need inflation for us producers to compete with foreign producers brusca said prices of electronic equipment dropped 08 pct in februarys ppi with many electronic goods produced overseas this may show that foreign producers are not raising prices which bodes ill for us competitiveness he said if further dollar declines are needed this could diminish overseas investment in us debt brusca added which might necessitate higher interest rates and lower bond prices by contrast slifer said imported goods prices rose 118 pct from first quarter 1985 to first quarter 1986 reflecting to a large degree a 22 pct drop in the tradeweighted real value of the dollar from february 1985 to february 1987 slifer said import prices may rise further as manufacturers contracts put in place before the dollar dropped to current levels expire and new contracts are made that reflect a weaker dollar david wyss of data resources inc noted that imported manufactured goods prices rose 85 pct at an annual rate in the second half of 1986 which has contributed to rising us industrial output its the other side of the lower dollar wyss said producers are beginning to find themselves more competitive and they are increasing output wyss said that the latest data point to an average industrial production gain of 0304 pct in the first quarter its an encouraging sign that the manufacturing sector is beginning to revive but stephen roach of morgan stanley and co inc was not convinced that the february reports portend economic gains he said much of the strength came from factors that do not point to a sustained rise in industrial output roach pointed out that stikers returning to work in farm equipment industries helped account for a one pct rise in february business equipment production utilities output rose 07 pct in february after gaining 12 pct in january but roach said it shows mostly that more energy was produced not that manufacturing activity gained finally he pointed out that auto production accounted for half of the industrial production gain as production of auto assemblies rose to 83 million units at an annual rate from 75 million units in the first quarter it looks like automakers are producing at an 85 mln unit annual rate but selling at roughly a seven mln unit rate roach said the disparity between output and sales is showing up in inventories economists pointed to sharp rise in january us business inventories as a sign that production may be outstripping demand in the first quarter of 1987 january business inventories rose 09 pct the largest gain since july 1979 when inventories rose 17 pct the commerce department said business sales dropped 45 pct in january the largest monthly
